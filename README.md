# Project Description
This project analyzes the factors influencing housing prices in Melbourne using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to identify key variables that affect property values through data cleaning, feature engineering, and linear regression modeling. Insights from this analysis can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals understand the market better.

# Installation Instructions
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/melbourne-housing-capstone.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd melbourne-housing-capstone

Install required Python libraries (preferably in a virtual environment):
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook Melbourne_Housing_Capstone.ipynb to explore the full analysis workflow from data cleaning to regression modeling.

The notebook includes:

Data loading and preprocessing

# Technologies Used
Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

# Methodology
Cleaned and preprocessed raw housing data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Engineered features such as number of rooms, type of home, region, number of bathrooms, parking spots, and building size.

Applied Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression to identify statistically significant predictors of housing prices.

Evaluated model performance using metrics like Adjusted R² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# Results
Identified key factors significantly influencing Melbourne housing prices, including number of rooms and location.

Developed a regression model that explains a meaningful portion of price variance, providing actionable insights into the real estate market.
